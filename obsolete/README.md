These Batch Files require gimp scripts that I seem to have lost the source code for.
It kind of defeats the original purpose of this repo.
I might be able to get those scripts back from an image of an old Windows 10 computer,
but they would need substantial work anyway since I need to upgrade from GIMP 2 to GIMP 3 anyway.
